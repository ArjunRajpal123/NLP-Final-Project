# NLP Final Project
 Final Project


## Note about Computer Requirements
1. We ran this notebook using Azure ML notebooks where we used a computer with 6 cores, 54 gb of ram, and an Nvidia Graphics Card. Even then, this code took several hours to run and the notebook was especially slow when producing results for the models using the ARP dataset. Ensure your computer is up to these specs before running.
