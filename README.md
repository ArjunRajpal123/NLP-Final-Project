# NLP Final Project
 Final Project

# Files and what they have/do
1. code_1.py - code for using LDA to generate word emeddings
2. output_Ida.txt - output from LDA + first 10 word embeddings

# Current Results 



1. LDA - there were two packages that I found that had a pre-built lda code - the one mentioned in our project preposal and another from sklearn - currently our code has only the code from the package mentiond in our project preposal (lda package) and not from sklearn. That being said I tried them both out and produced the following results

LDA package
Logistic Regresion
accuracy: 0.5514
F1 score:  0.6701567600952912
precision:  0.91144

sklearn - lda
Logistic Regresion
accuracy: 0.69172
F1 score:  0.674659124488159
